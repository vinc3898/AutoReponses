## About Me 👏
Hi, I am a student of Multimedia University (MMU) Malaysia. In fact, I am very new to App Script and github, so all comments are very welcome. I have developed this project for several purposes：

* To learn more about web development (HTML, CSS, Javascript)
* To learn more about features of Git and Github
* To allow MMU students to use this extension to help them with their projects
